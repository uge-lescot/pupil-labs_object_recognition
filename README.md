# pupil-labs_object_recognition
Real-Time Object Recognition plugin for pupil capture app

## Plugin for Pupil Capture, it provides : 
- detection of objects in the world video
- recognition of which object you are looking at, based on gaze data and Yolo coordinates.
- streaming of the video with objects detected on tcp, with compatibility with RTMaps (contact me for this)
- exporting data of which objects are in focus in a custom topic named "objects" in the IPC Backbone
- saving local .avi video and data of which objects are in focus in JSON

The plugin uses already trained Yolo models, but it is easy to add a custom model that can recognize other things than objects like facial emotion or whatever you need to.
